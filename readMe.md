# Complex Maze Solver Using AI Search Algorithms

## Overview
This project is a desktop application built with Python and Pygame that generates random mazes and solves them using various AI search algorithms. It offers an interactive environment where users can manually navigate mazes or observe autonomous AI solvers in action. The application visualizes pathfinding processes in real-time, allowing users to compare the efficiency and behavior of different algorithms.

The primary goal is to implement and showcase classic AI search techniques, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform-Cost Search, and A* Search with multiple heuristics, while providing an engaging and educational experience.
